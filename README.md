# Speech Emotion Recognition Music App

## Overview
The **Speech Emotion Recognition Music App** is an intelligent application that detects human emotions from speech input and plays suitable music using **SoundCloud** based on the recognized emotion.  
The goal of this project is to enhance user experience by combining **speech processing**, **machine learning**, and **emotion-aware music recommendation**.

## Features
- Speech input through microphone or audio files  
- Emotion detection from speech signals  
- Emotion classification (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Fearful, Disgust, Surprise)  
- Automatic music playback from SoundCloud based on detected emotion  
- User-friendly and interactive interface
